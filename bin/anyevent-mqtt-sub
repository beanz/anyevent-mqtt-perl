=head1 NAME

anyevent-mqtt-sub - Perl script for subscribing to an MQTT topic

=head1 VERSION

version 1.112340

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  anyevent-mqtt-sub [options] topic1 [topic2] [topic3] ...

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This script subscribes to one or more MQTT topics and prints any
messages that it receives to stdout.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over

=item B<-help>

Print a brief help message.

=item B<-man>

Print the manual page.

=item B<-host A.B.C.D>

The host running the MQTT service.  The default is C<127.0.0.1>.

=item B<-port NNNNN>

The port of the running MQTT service.  The default is 1883.

=item B<-qos N>

The QoS level for the published message.  The default is
0 (C<MQTT_QOS_AT_MOST_ONCE>).

=item B<-verbose>

Include more verbose output.  Without this option the script only
outputs errors and received messages one per line in the form:

  topic message

With one B<-verbose> options, publish messages are printed in a form
of a summary of the header fields and the payload in hex dump and text
form.

With two B<-verbose> options, summaries are printed for all messages
sent and received.

=item B<-keepalive NNN>

The keep alive timer value.  Defaults to 120 seconds.  For simplicity,
it is also currently used as the connection/subscription timeout.

=item B<-count NNN>

Read the specificed number of MQTT messages and then exit.  Default
is 0 - read forever.

=item B<-one> or B<-1>

Short for B<-count 1>.  Read one message and exit.

=item B<--no-retain>

Ignore retained messages.  That is, wait for new messages rather than
processing existing retained messages.
